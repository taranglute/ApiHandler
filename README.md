# ApiHandler
ApiHandler eases your tasks of validating JSON value attribute and returning the deserialized object which can be either processed for further actions or can be directly inserted into the Salesforce. In Rest API, JSON is the format used to share data. 
Json is a human-readable text consisting of attributes, keys and values.Below is the usual implementation, we follow while working with API.

### Validating Incoming Data
------------------------------------------------------
In API implementation, validating incoming data is very important. Below are some of the common validations.
  1. **Required Field** - Validating if required keys have values or not.
  2. **Format Checking** -  Validating if values are in the correct format or not. **For example: Email-Id**.
  3. **Typecasting** - Converting value type from one format to other. **For example- Integer to String**.

### Deserializing JSON to Object-
-------------------------------------------------------
Another important task is to deserialize valid JSON to an object. This object can be further used to perform activities like storing in DB.A common approach to creating an object is creating a wrapper and casting Json to the wrapper. Below are some of the problems we face with the wrapper.
  1. **Creating Wrapper** - In the case of multiple API, creating a wrapper for each API is not a good idea.
  2. **Managing Wrapper** - Managing fields i.e adding field or removing field or renaming field is tedious job.

### Getting Started with ApiHandler?
-------------------------------------------------------
API handler is driven by below three main objects -
1. **API Configuration**- This object holds the core mapping details between incoming or passed JSON versus SObject fields.
2. **FieldValidation**-  This is the Junction object between app validation and MasterValidation, to specify custom field level validation.
3. **MasterValidation**- This is a master object which stores custom validation with the error message, regex expression, and callback method

### Example
---------------------------------------------------------
Say you have Rest API know as *ContactAPI* to create a new contact. 
Sample JSON for same.
```
{
    "FirstName" : "Alex",
    "LastName" : "Smith‚Äù,
    "Email" : "Alex.Smith@ymail.com"
}
```
Map all JSON properties with Contact fields. For that, create records in AppValidation object for all JSON Properties. following is for "Firstname". 
**Points to Remember**
  - When we create record for each json properties name field should be same i.e *ContactAPI*
  - If you are marking field as isRequired then provide validation message as well.
